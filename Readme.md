# AzureBSFolderSync (Azure Blob Storage Folder Sync)

## Use case

Script is designed to upload some software backups folder (e.g. Acronic Backup, Team Foundation Server etc.) to Azure Blob Storage.
So, the main point is that software manages the backup retention period.
When file is removed from the destination folder - it'll be removed from Azure.
